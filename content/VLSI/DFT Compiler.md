## 설명

- **Funtion, Timing, 신호 합성, Power 조건을 방해하지 않고 Test Synthesis**

> ([[Design Compiler User Guide.pdf#page=42&selection=40,0,42,85|Design Compiler User Guide, p.42]])
> The DFT Compiler tool is the Synopsys advanced test synthesis solution. It enables transparent implementation of design-for-test capabilities into the Synopsys synthesis flow without interfering with functional, timing, signal integrity, or power requirements.
